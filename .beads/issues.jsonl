{"id":"event-machine-8joe","title":"fix(MachineDefinition): resolve events through registry instead of bypassing with caller's EventBehavior instance","description":"## Problem\n\n`initializeEvent()` at `MachineDefinition.php:506-508` bypasses the machine's own event registry when receiving an `EventBehavior` instance. This breaks the machine's authority over its own events - the caller's object (with its class, validation schema, etc.) is used as-is instead of the machine resolving through its type-string-based registry.\n\nThis is an architectural inconsistency: everywhere else in event-machine, the internal mapping is type-string-based. Config classes are resolved to type strings at construction time (`StateDefinition.php:257-259`), transitions are stored by type string, and transition lookup uses type string. Only `initializeEvent()` breaks this pattern.\n\n## Current Behavior (Bug)\n```php\nprotected function initializeEvent(EventBehavior|array $event, State $state): EventBehavior {\n    if ($event instanceof EventBehavior) {\n        return $event;  // BYPASS - caller's object used as-is\n    }\n    // ... registry-based resolution for arrays\n}\n```\n\n## Expected Behavior\nWhen an EventBehavior instance arrives, the machine should:\n1. Extract the type string from the event\n2. Look up its OWN registered class for that type string\n3. Re-instantiate using its own class (with its own validation)\n4. Preserve caller metadata (actor, isTransactional, source, version)\n5. Fall back to current behavior if type is not in registry\n\n## Implementation Plan\n\n### Phase 1: Fix initializeEvent() with backward compatibility\n- Extract type string from incoming EventBehavior\n- Check machine's behavior registry for that type\n- If same class as caller's → return as-is (optimization, no re-instantiation needed)\n- If different class → re-instantiate with machine's class, preserving actor/isTransactional/source/version\n- If not in registry → fall back to current behavior (return as-is)\n- Add deprecation notice when bypass fallback is used (prepare for major version removal)\n\n### Phase 2: Add getAcceptedEvents() and can() public API\n- `getAcceptedEvents(?StateDefinition $state = null): array` - returns type→class mapping\n  - Without arg: all events from MachineDefinition::$events + behavior registry\n  - With arg: events for specific state\n- `can(string|EventBehavior $event): bool` - checks if current state can handle event type\n  - Should evaluate guards if possible (like XState v5)\n\n### Phase 3: Backward compatibility strategy\n- The fix should NOT break existing code that sends the correct class\n- Same-class detection: if caller sends exactly the class the machine registered, skip re-instantiation\n- Registry miss: if event type isn't in registry, use caller's object (with deprecation warning)\n- This allows gradual migration in application code\n\n## Edge Cases \u0026 Test Plan\n\n### Tests for Phase 1:\n1. **Same class sent** → no re-instantiation, works exactly as before\n2. **Different class, same type string** → machine re-instantiates with its own class, validates with its own schema\n3. **Actor preservation** → actor field (private, set via constructor) must survive re-instantiation\n4. **isTransactional preservation** → caller's isTransactional value must be preserved\n5. **source preservation** → SourceType must be preserved\n6. **version preservation** → event version must be preserved\n7. **Event not in registry** → falls back to current behavior (EventBehavior returned as-is)\n8. **String-only event definition in config** → no class in registry, works as before\n9. **Machine's class has stricter validation** → re-instantiation catches invalid payload\n10. **Machine's class has different/additional payload fields** → handled gracefully\n11. **Hierarchical states** → event resolution works through parent chain\n12. **Parallel states** → event resolution works across regions\n\n### Tests for Phase 2:\n13. **getAcceptedEvents()** returns correct type→class mapping\n14. **getAcceptedEvents(state)** returns only that state's events\n15. **can()** returns true for valid event type in current state\n16. **can()** returns false for valid event type NOT in current state\n17. **can()** with guard evaluation\n\n## Files to Modify\n- `src/Definition/MachineDefinition.php` - initializeEvent(), new public methods\n- `src/Behavior/EventBehavior.php` - may need toArray()/extractData() helper for re-instantiation\n- `tests/` - new test file for event resolution behavior\n\n## Breaking Change Assessment\n- **Not a breaking change** if same-class optimization is implemented\n- Existing code that sends the correct class will work identically\n- Code that sends a different class (the bug case) will now get machine's validation → could expose hidden bugs in existing applications\n- Deprecation warnings guide migration","acceptance_criteria":"1. initializeEvent() resolves through registry for all inputs\n2. All 17 test cases pass\n3. Existing test suite passes without modification (backward compat)\n4. getAcceptedEvents() and can() public API available\n5.
